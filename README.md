**Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy - United Nations Dataset**
Life expectancy at birth is a measure of the average a living being is expected to live. It takes into account several demographic factors like gender, country, or year of birth.

Life expectancy at birth can vary along time or between countries because of many causes: the evolution of medicine, the degree of development of countries, or the effect of armed conflicts. Life expectancy varies between gender, as well. The data shows that women live longer that men. Why? Several potential factors, including biological reasons and the theory that women tend to be more health conscious.

**The NIST Special Publication 800-63B**
<p>In this notebook, we will go through the rules in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html">NIST Special Publication 800-63B</a> which details what checks a <em>verifier</em> (what the NIST calls a second party responsible for storing and verifying passwords) should perform to make sure users don't pick bad passwords. We will go through the passwords of users from a fictional company and use R to flag the users with bad passwords. But us being able to do this already means the fictional company is breaking one of the rules of 800-63B:</p>
