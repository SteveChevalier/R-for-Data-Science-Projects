# R for Data Science Projects
Selected project notebooks from my studies from DataCamp Career Tract: Data Science with R

**Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy - United Nations Dataset**
Life expectancy at birth is a measure of the average a living being is expected to live. It takes into account several demographic factors like gender, country, or year of birth.

Life expectancy at birth can vary along time or between countries because of many causes: the evolution of medicine, the degree of development of countries, or the effect of armed conflicts. Life expectancy varies between gender, as well. The data shows that women live longer that men. Why? Several potential factors, including biological reasons and the theory that women tend to be more health conscious.

**The NIST Special Publication 800-63B**
<p>In this notebook, we will go through the rules in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html">NIST Special Publication 800-63B</a> which details what checks a <em>verifier</em> (what the NIST calls a second party responsible for storing and verifying passwords) should perform to make sure users don't pick bad passwords. We will go through the passwords of users from a fictional company and use R to flag the users with bad passwords. But us being able to do this already means the fictional company is breaking one of the rules of 800-63B:</p>

**Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey**
In this project, we are going to find out what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work. Our data comes from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017?

**Wrangling and Visualizing Musical Data**
How do musicians choose the chords they use in their songs? Do guitarists, pianists, and singers gravitate towards different kinds of harmony?

**Functions for Food Price Forecasts**
In this notebook, we'll explore time series of food prices in Rwanda from the United Nations Humanitarian Data Exchange Global Food Price Database. Agriculture makes up over 30% of Rwanda's economy, and over 60% of its export earnings (CIA World Factbook), so the price of food is very important to the livelihood of many Rwandans.

**A Visual History of Noberl Prize Winners**
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the worlds most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?
